    <h1>About me</h1>

    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        I have an Associates of Science degree in Computer Science. My initial
        programming experience was with C++ which was very challenging but a lot
        of fun. I learned to build several projects including a tic tac toe
        played against a computer game along with a text based adventure game in
        C++.
        <br /><br />
        I have enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I feel it is
        more creative than C++. I am a creative person and I like expressing my
        creativity through programming. One thing I enjoy about programming is
        that there is no one single right way to complete a task, there are many
        ways to accomplish a task but everyone codes differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        From having very minimal experience with coding before the AS degree, I
        learned that I am capable of learning anything if I really put my mind
        to it. I learn well on my own but also will seek help when I absolutely
        need to. Programming has also taught me analytical thinking skills along
        with patience.
        <br /><br />
        When I am not learning new coding skills, I like to spend my free time
        baking desserts, especially cookies. I also enjoy going to the movies,
        playing with my two orange cats, and doing fun activities with my
        sisters.
